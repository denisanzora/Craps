1. A player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces. These faces contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 spots.
2. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated.
	CONDITIONS:
	- If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins.
	- If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on the first throw (called "craps"), the player loses (i.e. the "house" wins).
	- If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the first throw, then the sum becomes the player's "point." 
3. To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you "make your point." The player loses by rolling a 7 before making the point.
4. The game should allow for wagering. This means that you need to prompt that user for an initial bank balance from which wagers will be added or subtracted.
	- Before each roll prompt the user for a wager.
5. Once a game is lost or won, the bank balance should be adjusted.
6. As the game progresses, print various messages to create some "chatter" such as, "Sorry, you busted!", or "Oh, you're going for broke, huh?", 
   or "Aw cmon, take a chance!", or "You're up big, now's the time to cash in your chips!"
